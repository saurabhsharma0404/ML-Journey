  <b>K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</b>
    <p> KNN is a simple, comprehensible yet powerful tool for solving supervised learning problems.
      The value of K plays an important role in the accuracy of this algorithm.
      To classify a new observation <i>x</i>, first a sphere is drawn centered at <i>x</i> in a space(euclidean, manhattan etc.)
      containing <i>K</i> observations. Then, bayes rule is applied to ascertain which class does the new observation belongs to. 
      each new observation and the training observations.</p>
