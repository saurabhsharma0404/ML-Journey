  <b>K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</b>
    <p> KNN is a simple, comprehensible yet powerful tool for solving supervised learning problems. The value of K plays an important role in the accuracy of this algorithm. KNN goes through the whole dataset and computes the distance(euclidean, manhattan etc.) between each new observation and the training observations.</p>
