  <b>K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</b>
    <p> KNN is a simple, comprehensible yet powerful tool for solving supervised learning problems. 
      In statistics, KNN is a great alternative to Kernel density estimators.
      KNN technique for density estimation employs a fixed value of K to determine the density <i>p(x)</i>, where x is the new observation, at avolume of region containing the observation falling under a class. 
      The value of K plays an important role in the accuracy of this algorithm.
      I can going to separat two things KNN goes through the whole dataset and computes the distance(euclidean, manhattan etc.) between each new observation and the training observations.</p>
